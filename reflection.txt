	Since the begining of the semester the mention of this final project had me 
worried. I wasn't sure if I would understand enough of the material to be able to complete
such a project. As the semester went on I was doing pretty good in the class, I understood
a lot of what was being taught and my assignments were coming back with pretty good grades.
When the roup project came around I felt a bit worried but when working with my team it
didn't seem that hard. But I knew that the final project wasn't going to be quite like the
group project, there was going to be more to it.
	Starting the project I biuld what I had originally planned out, but it seemed that I
didn't really have as much information as expected. I went back through and added more 
tables to my Functional Dependencies and in turn each time I did so I had to adjest the 
Data Dictionary as well as the E-R Diagram. Once that was finally complete and I started on
the Script, it was going smoothly. That is until I got to the Foreign Keys, I had to rearrange
tables and had to fix a couple misplacements in the Constraint areas to finally get them
going. After that came to hard part, using all the new information to impliment them into 
my Script. I refered back to my book and assignments a few times as examples but had to 
change them up a bit to get them to do what I wanted in my Script. A few errors occured 
here and there and it turned out to be time consuming, but was very satisfying to get them
to finally work. All in all I think the finl project went pretty well and I hope to add 
more to the script in the future to have it do other things.
