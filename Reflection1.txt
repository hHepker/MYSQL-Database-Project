	Since the begining of the semester the mention of this final project had me a bit
worried. I wasn't sure if I would understand enough of the material to be able to complete
such a project. As the semester went on, I began to understand
a lot of what was being taught. My assignments were coming back with pretty good grades, 
boosting my confidence in myself.

When the group project came around I began to worry again. Once our team started working together, 
things just kind of fell into place. I knew that the final project was going to be more of a challenge. 
I just dove in and began using what I had learned.

	Starting the project I built what I had originally planned out, it seemed that I
didn't really have as much information as I felt I needed. Going back through, I added more 
tables to my Functional Dependencies. In turn, each time I did so I had to adjust the 
Data Dictionary as well as the E-R Diagram. Once that part was completed, and I started on
the Script, it was went much more smoothly. That is, until I got to the Foreign Keys. I had to end 
up rearranging tables and then had to fix a couple of misplacements in the Constraint areas to 
finally get them going. 

Then came the hard part, using all of the new information to implement into my Script. 
I referred back to my book, notes, and assignments a few times as examples, but had to 
change them up to get them to do what I wanted in my Script. A few errors occured 
here and there, and it turned out to be time consuming, but ended up to be very satisfying to get 
them to finally work.

All in all, I think the final project went pretty well and I hope to add more to the script 
in the future to have it do more things. I learned a lot and hope to continue to advance my
knowledge in my future classes.
